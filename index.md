## About me
Nice to meet you, my name is Wei Dong (董未). You can call me Wei, with the same pronunciation as Way. I'm from [Huzhou (湖州)](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Huzhou,+Zhejiang,+China/@30.868142,120.0639318,31949m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x344b4b68f92db705:0x34467013b412f4f0!8m2!3d30.89441!4d120.086809), a small city near Shanghai.

I'm a researcher at Apple with [Stephan Richter](http://www.stephanrichter.org/) and [Vladlen Koltun](https://vladlen.info). I spent 9 months in the same team as a Postdoc before becoming a full-time employee. In the summer of 2023, I received my PhD in Robotics at Robotics Institute, CMU, advised by [Michael Kaess](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kaess/). Before that, I obtained my Master's and Bachelor's degrees from Peking University, China, advised by [Hongbin Zha](https://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/info/1177/1379.htm).  My CV can be found [here](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).

I work on realistic 3D reconstruction. It is always interesting to play with scenes from the real-world. My goal is to reproduce the physical world in the cyber space, and make it accessible to everyone -- we can live and relive the past, present, and future lives, ours and others'.

In my leisure time, I've been one of the maintainers of [Open3D](https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D). I play video games. [FromSoftware](https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/) is my favorite game studio. I also read and write fictions, run, bike, learn new languages, and play the piano. I live with my wife, our cats, and toys.
